# CharityZone
A decentralized charity system currently under development for a course in college

The real world charity systems are not transparent and hence not trust-worthy. 
Donors are not willing to donate even though they are interested in donating the same due to a lack of trust. 
There is also no proper system for checking to validate beneficiaries. 

Hence we have built a charity system based on blockchain
